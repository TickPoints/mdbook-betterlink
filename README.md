# BetterLink
BetterLink is designed to provide better hyperlink effects for MDBOOK.

## Why
It addresses some pain points I perceive regarding hyperlinks in MDBook:
- [*] Adds `<a>` tags to headings in other languages (for convenience, currently adds them unconditionally to all headings)
- [ ] Checks for invalid links

## How
BetterLink is a plugin that functions as a preprocessor. You can use BetterLink just like any other plugin.
